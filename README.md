## Introduction 
The introduction of sorghum in northern France raised a major issue : the lack of chilling tolerance of this crop, which is grown mainly in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. However, the cultivation of sorghum could be an interesting alternative to maize. Due to Climate Change, more and more areas in France will have to face constraints on water resources. Yet, sorghum is considered a more robust crop than maize associated with a high water consumption during the summer.  Therefore, there’s a need to target for selection the current varieties’ chilling tolerance in a cold scenario similar to the complex agronomic conditions encountered in France. 
-> current state of research :  Most research on sorghum's chilling tolerance has been conducted under controlled conditions at constant temperatures or in early field planting in the Midwest (Kansas, …) : quite far from the complex cold scenario of France.
-> issues : develop tests to characterize genetic diversity with respect to these target scenarios + avoid the selection of undesirable traits while selecting chilling tolerance.
